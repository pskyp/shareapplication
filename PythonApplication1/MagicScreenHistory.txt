It is a rapidly growing gold producer with its flagship project, the Sukari Gold Mine, located in the Eastern Desert of Egypt some 25km from the Red Sea coast. Gold production at Sukari commenced in June 2009 making Sukari the first modern mine in Egypt, a country which in ancient times was a prolific producer of the yellow metal. In 2010 the mine is scheduled to produce 200,000 ounces of gold at lower quartile cash costs per ounce. With a resource of 10.99 million ounces Measured and Indicated, and 3.5 million ounces Inferred, and a 7.1 million ounce reserve base, the Company is implementing a rapid expansion program to increase production to circa 500,000 oz per year over the next three years.

The Company's unhedged and debt free position, coupled with a growing resource and reserve base in a relatively unexplored region, positions it to grow and deliver superior results to its shareholders as well as its stakeholders.	-18.46	5.06	0.75	0.14	1.05	24.77	0.98	15.32	-58.74	-19.35	2017	31 Dec 2017	851	169	0	1020	105	34	360	10	1529	66	11	0	77	1452	669	0	779	0	4	1452	359	254	-42	676	414	261	221	224	109	1136	19.454225352112676	3.0	119.0	122.0	18.0	9	0	4	0	0	Overweight	999004	1.0	19.0	4.5

In 2010, the Company was the fourth largest gold producer in Russia by production volume and its largest silver producer by production volume, ranked eighth worldwide. Since its founding, the Group has built its asset portfolio by developing new mines, restarting operations put on care and maintenance and acquiring an operating mine. It has increased its annual gold equivalent production from 333 Koz in 2003 to 753 Koz in 2010, a compound annual growth rate of 11 per cent. This strong growth rate primarily resulted from the Group's ability to manage the transition of its mines from development projects into full-scale producing operations by leveraging the extensive in-house expertise of its employees. Polymetal International plc aims to produce over 800 Koz of gold, silver and copper in 2011 (in Au eq. oz) and over 1.4 Moz of gold, silver and copper in 2014 (in Au eq. oz) as a result of continuing to operate existing projects and commissioning new projects, all of which are currently in construction phase or in ramp-up phase. As of 1 July 2011, Polymetal International's resource base included 15.0 Moz of proven and probable gold, silver and copper reserves (in Au eq. oz) according to the JORC Code, 13.5 Moz of gold, silver and copper resources (in Au eq. oz) classified as measured, indicated and inferred (JORC Code). The Group currently owns gold and silver mines and carries out operations in Russia and Kazakhstan. The Group also produces a limited amount of copper concentrate as a by-product of producing gold at one of its processing centres. The Group organises its mining operations into six main operational units: the Dukat hub, the Amursk POX hub, the Omolon hub, the Voro stand-alone mine, the Varvara stand-alone mine and the Khakanja stand-alone mine; and stand-alone exploration operations.	57.07	58.22	55.15	0.88	2.39	2.75	2.31	15.2	-11.83	62.96	2017	31 Dec 2017	2054	18	295	2367	514	71	36	140	3128	214	1607	0	1821	1307	2031	0	406	0	-1130	1307	533	56	-11	1815	1106	709	510	443	354	4808	10.607321131447588	19.0	120.0	139.0	30.0	6	0	5	1	2	Hold	666005	7.0	37.0	23.0

As at 30 June 2017, Hays had 10,000 employees in 250 offices in 33 countries. In many of its global markets, the vast majority of professional and skilled recruitment is still done in-house, with minimal outsourcing to recruitment agencies which presents substantial long-term structural growth opportunities. This has been a key driver of the rapid diversification and internationalisation of the Group, with the International business representing c76% of the Group's net fees, compared with 30% 10 years ago. Its 6,884 consultants work in a broad range of sectors with no sector specialism representing more than 20% of Group net fees. While Accountancy & Finance, Construction & Property and IT represent 51% of Group net fees, our expertise across 20 professional and skilled recruitment specialisms gives it opportunities to rapidly develop newer markets by replicating these long-established, existing areas of expertise. In addition to this international and sectoral diversification, the Group's net fees are generated 59% from temporary and 41% permanent placement markets, and this balance gives its business model relative resilience.	46.66	55.22	1.08	0.01	2.23	19.1	4.6	34.51	10.78	11.03	2017	30 Jun 2017	24	242	23	289	0	908	112	0	1309	717	6	0	723	586	15	0	94	369	108	586	134	113	43	5081	0	0	212	205	139	3326	6.374022850270595	78.0	48.0	126.0	22.5	2	0	7	0	2	Hold	222007	22.5	45.0	25.0
